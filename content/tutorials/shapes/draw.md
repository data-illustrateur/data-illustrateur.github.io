To draw a freefrom path on the canvas, select the Pen Tool, every click on the canvas generates a new vertex and extends the path to that point. To create a closed path, finish the path by clicking on the first vertex. To create an open path, press the "esc" key after the last vertex you want to create. You can change how the vertices are connected through the "Curve Mode" property.
