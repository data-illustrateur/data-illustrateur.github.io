You can export your work as an SVG file, and embed it in a webpage or open it in other vector editors. To export as SVG, use the "Export" button in the Tool Bar.

You can also save your work in a "diproj" file on your computer, and open it later using Data Illustrateur. To do so, use the "Save" and "Open" buttons in the Tool Bar.
