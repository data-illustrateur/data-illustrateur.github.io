Data Illustrateur's interface consists of seven components:

1. **Tool Bar**, which provides selection tools, drawing tools, and action buttons
2. **Canvas**, where you select, draw and manipulate items
3. **Data Panel**, where you can import and see data tables
4. **Layers Panel**, which shows items (e.g., shapes, groups, axes and legends) and their organizations in the canvas
5. **Property Inspector**, which shows properties of selected items, and provides controls to change or bind data to properties
