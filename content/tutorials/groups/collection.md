The repeat and divide actions generate a **collection** of shapes. You may think of a collection as a "group" of shapes, where all the shapes in a collection have the same type (e.g., rectangle, line, path) and represent values of the same categorical variable. Each shape in a collection represents a unique value of the categorical variable. 

In Data Illustrateur, a selected collection is drawn with a green dashed border, as shown in the figure below. 
To select a shape inside a collection, double click on the shape. This will "open up" the collection, and its border is changed to a lighter shade of green.
